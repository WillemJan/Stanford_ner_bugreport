Stanford NER bugreport.

There is a bug in the Stanford NER Library which results in fewer named-entities while processing the same text.

What happens is the following:

I start the stanford NER tool from command line as a server:
(stanford-ner-2015-04-20)

java -mx700m -cp ./stanford-ner.jar: edu.stanford.nlp.ie.NERServer -loadClassifier dutch.gz -port 1234

Then I start a simple python script to get text in via telnet:
In the first run I get 71 named-entities, in the second run I only get 69..

python python-ner.py  > 1st_run
python python-ner.py  > 2nd_run
wfa010@lapbak:~$ diff 1st_run 2nd_run 
16d15
< Nous/B-PER
48d46
< Vive/B-PER

This effect even might increase over runtime.

At the National Library of the Netherlands we are currently processing milion's of ocr'ed texts with the stanford library,
